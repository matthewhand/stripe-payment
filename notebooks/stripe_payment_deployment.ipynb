The base URL for all requests is `https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/`. Here are some of the key points from the [Netlify API documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/api/get-started/):\n\n- **Authentication**: Netlify uses OAuth2 for authentication. All requests must use HTTPS. You can generate a personal access token in your Netlify user settings for manual authentication in shell scripts or commands that use the Netlify API.\n- **Rate Limiting**: The Netlify API is rate-limited to 500 requests per minute. The returned HTTP headers of any API request can be checked to verify the current rate limit status.\n- **Deploying with the API**: Netlify supports two ways of deploying: sending a digest of all files in your deploy and then uploading any files Netlify doesnâ€™t already have on its storage servers, or sending a ZIP file of the entire site and letting Netlify unzip and deploy.\n- **Sites Endpoint**: The `/sites` endpoint allows you to access sites deployed on Netlify. You can make a request for all sites you have access to by appending the sites index path to the base URL to form something like `https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/sites`.\n- **Deploys Endpoint**: The `/deploys` endpoint allows you to access all deploys for a specific site.\n\nTo interact with the Netlify API using Python, we can use the `requests` library. Here's an example of how to create a new site on Netlify using the API:",

      "source": "## Interacting with ChatGPT\n\nChatGPT is a powerful language model developed by OpenAI. It can generate human-like text based on the prompts you give it. Here are some tips on how to interact with ChatGPT effectively:\n\n- **Be specific in your prompts**: The more specific you are in your prompt, the more likely ChatGPT is to generate the response you're looking for. For example, instead of asking 'Tell me about climate change', you could ask 'What are the main causes of climate change according to scientists?'.\n\n- **Use system messages**: System messages are a great way to set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can use a system message to tell the assistant to speak like Shakespeare, to be more creative, or to explain things like a 5th grader.\n\n- **Adjust temperature and max tokens**: The 'temperature' setting controls the randomness of the AI's responses. A higher value like 0.8 makes the output more random, while a lower value like 0.2 makes it more deterministic. The 'max tokens' setting controls the maximum length of the response.\n\n- **Use the 'continue' prompt**: If the assistant's response is cut off or if you want it to generate more content, you can use the 'continue' prompt. However, be aware that very long generations might fail due to the model's token limit. In such cases, you can ask the assistant to continue, but also break it down into multiple steps to avoid failure.\n\n- **Type in your next prompt while waiting for the last to generate**: You don't have to wait for the assistant to finish generating its response before you type in your next prompt. Feel free to have as many updates as you want.\n\nRemember, interacting with ChatGPT is an iterative process. It might take a few tries to get the response you want, but with a bit of practice, you'll get the hang of it!",

We'll filter this list to only include files with the `.ipynb` extension.\n\n2. **Sort and select notebooks**: We'll sort the notebooks by their last modified date and select the most recent 3.\n\n3. **Analyze notebooks**: We'll download the selected notebooks and analyze their content. We'll look at the number of cells, the types of cells (code, markdown, etc.), and the content of the cells.\n\n4. **Summarize notebooks**: We'll create two summaries for each notebook. The first summary will be very brief, including only the most important information like the number of cells and the main topics covered in the notebook. The second summary will be more detailed, including information about the types of cells and a brief description of the content of each cell.\n\n5. **Update ChatGpt instructions**: We'll update the instructions for interacting with ChatGpt to include an example of how to use multiple consecutive prompts to execute a complex task like this one.",

This could be analyzing the content of the notebooks.\n\n3. **Subsequent prompts**: Continue prompting ChatGPT to perform the remaining steps of the task. This could include summarizing the notebooks, updating a file with the summaries, etc.\n\nRemember, each prompt should be specific and clear to ensure that ChatGPT understands exactly what you want it to do.
