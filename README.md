# Stripe Payment Project

This project was entirely developed using ChatGPT and the Noteable plugin. It demonstrates the implementation of:

- A Stripe donation button, including the creation of the payment link via the Stripe API.
- Deploying code to GitHub using the GitHub API.
- Creation of a GitHub README.md that includes a generated image.
- A NodeJS Stripe deployment to Vercel hosting via the Vercel API.

## Donation Button

If you find this project useful, you can support its development by making a donation. Think of it as buying me a coffee. Click on the button below to make a donation. You can choose an amount between 1 and 99.
