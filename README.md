# Stripe Payment Project

This project was entirely developed using ChatGPT and the Noteable plugin. It demonstrates the implementation of:

- A Stripe donation button, including the creation of the payment link via the Stripe API.
- Deploying code to GitHub using the GitHub API.
- Creation of a GitHub README.md that includes a generated image.
- A NodeJS Stripe deployment to Vercel hosting via the Vercel API.
